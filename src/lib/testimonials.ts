During my time with him at Brainstation, I have been profoundly impacted by Christopher’s remarkable leadership and people skills. He naturally takes the initiative to lead but also graciously creates space for others to shine. Christopher’s encouragement extends beyond his peers; he uplifts any environment he is in. 

Christopher is incredibly reliable and trustworthy. He is always there when you need him and never fails to honor his commitments. Additionally, he is an honest, genuine, and authentic man, qualities that are increasingly rare and invaluable.

He has a very curious mind and is always eager to learn something new. This eagerness to expand his knowledge and skills makes him a dynamic and forward-thinking individual.

What stands out most about Christopher is his heart of gold. At Brainstation, I have seen him offer a helping hand to classmates, including myself, and provide encouragement when it was needed most. His positive and bright outlook is infectious, often lifting the mood of everyone around him.

I am deeply grateful for Christopher’s unconditional support, camaraderie, and brilliant mind. His presence at Brainstation made my experience not only more enriching but also more enjoyable. Meeting him has been one of the highlights of my time there.

Any employer would be incredibly fortunate to have Christopher on their team. His blend of integrity, compassion, and talent is truly rare. I have high faith that he will be a great person who will impact the world one day.`

        title: "Software Engineering | Natural Resources, Healthcare, Banking, Education | ex-IBM",
        testimonial: `I have been fortunate to have met and worked with Chris during our time in BrainStation's Software Engineering program. I remember seeing him in our first week in the program offering support to every student in our Slack channel and proposing solutions to many HTML/CSS questions in the beginning of the program. I messaged him saying 'Hey Chris, you’re the CSS wizard I’ve heard of, I come to you with major questions' and he was humble from the get go and stayed up for hours working through problems with me (even though he may have had tasks of his own or sleep to get to, it was never something he mentioned) - this speaks to Chris' willingness to go out of his way to support a team member in achieving excellence. 

I know Chris to be an extremely talented software developer with extreme attention to detail and organization of code. I know him to be an empathetic, hardworking, and dedicated team member with the impressive ability to adapt to new personalities and accept feedback thoughtfully. 

Any employer would be incredibly lucky to have Chris on their development team; he is sure to make an impact from day one on the job.`
